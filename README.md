Using the dataset from Chars74k

SVM and CNNs comparison. 
By using SVM, the val dataset(10% of total) is about 65%, and CNNs is about 77%

I tested the image data i collected from Google and the performs is very ok since the
images i collected are very 'bad' images... which are very different from training image from 
Chars74K

I tested the images i collected for training, the perform is also very good.

This is just an exercise for me to know how to use CNNs by Keras.
